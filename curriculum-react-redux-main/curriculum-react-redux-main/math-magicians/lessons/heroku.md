## Description

**IMPORTANT NOTE: _Heroku Buildpack for create-react-app_ is now at its end of life ðŸŒ…. Therefore, you should skip this lesson. Feel free to mark it as complete in your Dashboard.**

In this lesson, you will learn how to deploy your React application using the popular service Heroku.

### Why is Heroku important?

Heroku is one of the first (since 2007) and most popular cloud platforms you can use to deploy your applications. It has a free tier that should be more than enough for testing or hosting a small production app. It offers support for React applications.

### Deploying to Heroku

**Requirements:**

- First of all, you need to [create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/). The *free account* is enough; you can check its resources and limits [here](https://www.heroku.com/free).
- You should download and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).
- You also need Node and Git installed (by now, you should have them).

**Deploying:**

Heroku has developed a tool called *Heroku Buildpack for create-react-app* that will automate the process of deploying your app.

- Follow the instructions in the official [repo](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack), see the *Usage* section.

## Additional materials
