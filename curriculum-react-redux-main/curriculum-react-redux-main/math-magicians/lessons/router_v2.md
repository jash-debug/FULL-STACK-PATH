# Router

## Learning objectives

- Use React Router.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn how to **add several pages to a React Single Page Application (SPA)** and **navigate through them using React Router**.

### Why is React Router important?

A SPA consists of a single HTML page. Whenever you want to navigate to a different page, the application makes an asynchronous HTTP request to fetch new data. However, it's much more intuitive for users (as well as relevant for search engines) to have path changes in the URL: `/about` or `/account`.

React doesn't offer that functionality, but luckily for us there is a package called [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) that does!

### Routing with React Router

To learn what **routing** is and how to do routing with React using the popular React Router package, read the article [Routing with React Router](../articles/react_router.md).
