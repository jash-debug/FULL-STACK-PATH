# Math Magicians: tests

## Learning objectives

- Write unit tests with React Testing Library.
- Write unit tests with snapshots with Jest.

### Estimated time: 3h

## Description

In this project, you will write unit tests for the Math Magicians app, using the *Jest* and *React Testing Library* libraries.

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

You will add tests to the Math Magicians app using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro). Take a look at their documentation.

- Set up *React Testing Library*.
  - Follow the instructions in the official [documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).
  - You don't need to setup Jest (it's included in Create React App).
- Write unit tests for the files `operate.js` and `calculate.js` using Jest.
- Create unit tests for all React components:
  - Use Jest snapshots to test the components.
  - Use React Testing Library to simulate user interaction.
- Run your full tests suite using Jest. All tests should pass.
