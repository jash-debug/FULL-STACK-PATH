# Math Magicians: setup

## Learning objectives

- Set up a React app.
- Use React documentation.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

This is the first project of the *Math Magicians* application. You will set up the environment and tools needed to develop a React application. In the following projects, you will develop the actual application.

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config). **Remember that this is your first React project and it requires a special linters setup. Check the instructions in the linters-config README.**
- Make sure that you used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- Create a feature branch for the following changes.
- First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
- The easiest way to create a React application is using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- The application should run in the browser without errors

[Read this FAQ for a reminder on how to submit your project.](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234)

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your project.

# Additional requirements

*These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, feel free to implement them. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.*

*If you decide to implement these requirements you should do it in a separate pull request. As always, remember to clearly document your decision in GitHub comments.*

To get familiar with your application, read the [Getting started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) guide on CRA documentation. Pay special attention to:

- [Folder structure](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure), to learn how to modify the app.
- [Available scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts), to learn how to run, test and build the app.

To debug React applications, you can install the browser extension **React Developer Tools**, which is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi), and [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/react-developer-tools/gpphkfbcpidddadnkolkpfckpihlkkil). Read this [guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html) to learn how to use it.
