# Math magicians: fetch data from API

## Learning objectives

- Use the correct React hook when fetching data
- Connect to an API within a functional component
- Show different UI outputs depending on the component state

### Estimated time: 2.5h

## Description

In this project, you will **fetch data from an external API** to display "quotes" alongside your calculator.

_IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project._

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- Use the following external API: [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/quotes)
- Create a new component for displaying a quote
- Fetch data inside of a new component
- Show a `loading` state
- Show an `error` state
- Import the new component into your main component (next to the Calculator)
  - It should be on the same page as the Calculator

_Note: Practice what you have learned until now: use `useEffect` and `props`._
