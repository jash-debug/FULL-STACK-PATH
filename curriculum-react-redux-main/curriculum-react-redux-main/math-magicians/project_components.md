# Math magicians: components

## Learning objectives

- Use React components.
- Use React props.


### Estimated time: 3.5h

## Description

In this project, you should continue with the development of the Math Magicians app. You will develop a React component that will hold the core functionality: a calculator.

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

In the previous project, you worked on the setup of a React application using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), now you should:

- **Delete all the boilerplate** from Create React App (text, images, styles).
- **Create a new directory** called `components`.
- Inside `components`, create a new `Calculator.js` file.
- In `Calculator.js`, create a React component that matches this design:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/calculator.png" alt="Calculator" width="300px" />
</p>

- Implement the **design only** (JSX and CSS)
    -  Develop just the UI of the calculator; the math logic to make it work will be added in the next project.
- Use **functional** components
- Create at least **1 child component**
- Once the `Calculator` is ready, import it and **use it in your top-level component**: `App.js`
- **Test it in the browser**; it should render without problems.

_NOTE: Don't add any extra design. Don't add any logic._
