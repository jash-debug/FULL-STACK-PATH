# Math Magicians: refactor with hooks❗️❗️

## ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️IMPORTANT NOTE: If you already use functional components, you can create a GitHub issue in which you describe how you use functional components and ask for a code review based on your issue.

## Learning objectives

- Use React hooks.

### Estimated time: 2.5h

## Description

In this project you will refactor the Calculator component you developed in the past projects. Instead of using class based components, you will use now hooks.

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- Refactor the Calculator component (`components/Calculator.js`) from a class based component to a functional component with *hooks*.
- After the refactor is done, test the app in the browser. It should keep the same functionality.

 ❗❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️ **IMPORTANT NOTE: If you already use functional components, you can carete a GitHub issue in which you describe how you use functional components and ask for a code review base don your issue.**
