# Redux intro

## Learning objectives

- Understand the concept of state management.
- Use Redux documentation.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

So far you've learned about React components that use the concept of _state_. However, it was always a local state that was impacting only a given component.
As your application grows you may need to control the state of several components at once or have one global state.
For example, you may want to present a different user interface in your components depending on whether the user is signed in or not.
Global state management in large applications requires a dedicated system - and that's exactly what Redux offers.

### Why is Redux important?

UI libraries and frameworks like React usually don't offer any data management systems.
Most modern applications rely heavily on data, so having a reliable system to control the application's global state and manipulate data is a must.
Redux quickly became very popular among JS developers because of its simple yet powerful concepts that bring order and predictability to working with large amounts of data in interactive applications.
A great set of dedicated tools makes it an excellent choice for React applications.

### Your first meeting with Redux

The goal of this lesson is to give you a high-level understanding of Redux.

- First of all read [this text](https://medium.com/leanjs/introduction-to-redux-redux-explained-with-very-simple-examples-b39d7967ceb8) that is using an interesting metaphor for covering the Redux state updates.
- Secondly, check the official documentation of Redux. The part about [Redux Terms and Concept](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#redux-terms-and-concepts) will give you an idea of what you will be learning about soon!

**Remember that this lesson is just an introduction. You will learn more about the state, store, actions, reducers, and immutability in dedicated lessons.**
