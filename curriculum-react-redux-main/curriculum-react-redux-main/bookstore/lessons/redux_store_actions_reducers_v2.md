# Redux - store, actions, reducers

## Learning objectives

- Use store, actions, and reducers in Redux.
- Use Redux documentation.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description

You already have a general idea of what Redux is - now it's time to get to the details!

### Why is it important?

As mentioned in the introduction, **most modern applications rely heavily on data**, so having a reliable system to control the application's global state and manipulate data is of crucial importance.

Redux quickly became very popular among JavaScript developers because of its simple yet powerful concepts that bring **order and predictability** to working with large amounts of data in modern frontend applications.

### Core concepts

Now, please read this article about the [core concepts of Redux](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#redux-terms-and-concepts):

- State management
- Immutability
- Actions
- Action creators
- Reducers
- Store
- Dispatch
- Selectors

### Redux Toolkit: the recommended approach

Implementing Redux can be an overly complex process. As a result, the team behind the library released an official library intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic: [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

In order to implement it all you need to do now is:

1. Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux
2. Create a Redux Store
3. Provide the Redux Store to React
4. Create a Redux State Slice
5. Add Slice Reducers to the Store
6. Use Redux State and Actions in React Components

We recommend you go through the [official documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) and follow the steps to get familiar with how the library works.

### Redux DevTools

In order to help your development workflow, the creators of Redux have created a handy browser extension to **help you debug your Redux logic** in real-time!

### Redux recap

In this lesson, we covered all the essential parts of Redux and Redux Toolkit.

Before you move to more practical activities:

- Please read again about [Redux Terms and Concept](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#redux-terms-and-concepts) (you have read it in the Redux intro lesson) and check if it is more clear now!
- Check this [Redux cheatsheet](../articles/redux_cheatsheet.md).
