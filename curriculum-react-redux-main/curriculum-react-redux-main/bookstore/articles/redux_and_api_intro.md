# Redux and API: Intro

### Redux and async data

As you already know, when working with remote data that is fetched from a server, we are dealing with _async_ operations. But, as redux [documentation](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic#redux-middleware-and-side-effects) explains:

> "By itself, a Redux store doesn't know anything about async logic. It only knows how to synchronously dispatch actions, update the state by calling the root reducer function, and notify the UI that something has changed."

To be able to work with async data, you should learn about _middleware_ and _side effects_.

In Redux Toolkit, **middleware** refers to a layer of code that sits between the dispatch action and the reducer. It allows you to **modify or enhance the behavior of your store**.

Middlewares are **chainable**, which means that you can have several middlewares that will be called one after the other _(we will see in the next section below)_.

One of the foundations of Redux is that you should _avoid side effects_ in reducers, but middlewares are different because they are designed to work with side effects in a safe way. Redux middlewares can do _anything_ when they see a dispatched action: modify the action, delay the action, make an async call, etc.

#### Using the `thunk` middleware

```javascript
const fetchTodosMiddleware = (storeAPI) => (next) => (action) => {
  if (action.type === "todos/fetchTodos") {
    // Make an API call to fetch todos from the server
    fetch("todos").then((todos) => {
      // Dispatch an action with the todos we received
      storeAPI.dispatch({ type: "todos/todosLoaded", payload: todos })
    })
  }
  
```

But, what is a "thunk"? In general programming, a **thunk** is a programming term that means a piece of code that does some delayed (asynchronous) work.

In Redux Toolkit, it is a higher-order function that allows for **asynchronous actions and state updates** in your Redux store. It's a way to handle **side-effects such as API calls or other asynchronous actions in a Redux store**, allowing you to delay or conditionally dispatch actions.

- A middleware is just a function. You can create your middleware or use an existing one.
- It has access to the store, `storeAPI` in the example.
- It has access to the `action`.
- You can do _something_ based on that: `if (action.type === 'todos/fetchTodos')`.
- It has a `next` function. Since middlewares are chainable, once you have finished with the current one, you should call `next()`, to execute the next middleware in the chain, and you can pass arguments (in this case, we are passing again the action).

### Thunks vs. middlewares

In Redux Toolkit, both **thunks** and **middleware** are used to handle side-effects and perform asynchronous operations in your Redux store, but they differ in terms of their purpose and how they are used.

A **thunk** refers to a higher-order function that returns a function that dispatches an action. A **middleware** refers to a layer of code that sits between the dispatched action and the reduction of the state.

#### How to work with side effects in Redux

```javascript
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux"
import thunk from "redux-thunk"
import rootReducer from "./reducers"

const GET_CURRENT_USER = "GET_CURRENT_USER"
const GET_CURRENT_USER_SUCCESS = "GET_CURRENT_USER_SUCCESS"
const GET_CURRENT_USER_FAILURE = "GET_CURRENT_USER_FAILURE"

const getUser = () => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: GET_CURRENT_USER })
    return fetch("your-api-endpoint/users").then(
      (user) => dispatch({ type: GET_CURRENT_USER_SUCCESS, user }),
      (err) => dispatch({ type: GET_CURRENT_USER_FAILURE, err })
    )
  }
}
```
