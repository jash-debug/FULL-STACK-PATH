# Sneak peek: Bookstore

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to parse a Zeplin design to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website built in the previous module. You will create an MVP version of it that allows you to:
- Display a list of books.
- Add a book.
- Remove a selected book.

By building this application, you will learn how to use React and Redux.

### How to build the Bookstore website

You will need to build a website with two subpages: "Books" and "Categories." However, you will only need to implement the "Books" part (see the image below). The "Categories" page will stay empty in this MVP.

You can check the full design file in [Zeplin project](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5b35a9e13227086040f8eb75/screen/5b695e29bb8c844f118f9378) where you can also check the exact dimensions of all elements.
