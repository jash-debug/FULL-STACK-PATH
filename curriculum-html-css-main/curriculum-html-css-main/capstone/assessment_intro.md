### Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of mastering learning objectives.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this lesson you will see what project you will be able to build after mastering all learning objectives assigned in this module. You will also learn how you will be assessed and you will discover how to prepare for this assessment.

### Why is it important?

In order to foster your learning process you need to understand what your goal is. This goal is described with learning multiple objectives. Those objectives can guide you through all activities in this module, so you always understand why you are learning about specific things and what knowledge and skills we expect you to master.

Thanks to that you have more ownership over your learning process and also more confidence in your progress! Besides, you can also get excited today about the things youâ€™re about to build in a few weeks!
