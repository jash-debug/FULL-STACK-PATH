# Assessment score

## Description

Your assessment score reflects how well you mastered the crucial learning objectives in the current module. It takes into account your technical skills and soft skills. The main question this score is trying to answer is are you able to build the product requested by the client in a given technology stack and explain what skills you used in order to achieve that?

## Rules

You will need to answer 16 questions. For each question, you can receive 0-4 points. Your submission will be reviewed by two independent reviewers and the average number of points for each question will be calculated.

The maximum score is 64 points. Each answer scored as 0 or 1 is considered a missing or wrong answer.

In order to pass the assessment you need to get at least a Satisfactory level (>=41 points) and you cannot miss any of the questions (you need to get >=2 points) for all of the assessed learning objectives.
