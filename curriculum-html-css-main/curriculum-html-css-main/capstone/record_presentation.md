### Instructions

### Requirements

- ❗️⏰   ***You need to request the assessment of your presentation video by Thursday 23:59 your program time. If you fail to submit your presentation by the deadline, it will be marked as incomplete and you will be asked to repeat the block.***
- The video should last ~30min. It cannot be longer than 35 min (your assessor will watch your video only until the maximum time limit).
- The video should always show your face; even at the moments when you are sharing your screen.
- In the video you should provide evidence of mastering the learning objectives from the [assessment rubric](https://dashboard.microverse.org/student_assessments/rubrics).
    - **Note: you should have mastered all of the learning objectives, but in the video you will be asked to present the randomly selected ones.**
    - You should have received an email with **a presentation outline with randomly selected questions** today. You can also access it through your Dashboard. If that is not the case, reach out to the Student Success team.


### Recording the presentation

1. Keep your presentation outline open or make handwritten notes of what you are going to present.
2. Record the video.
    - You can use Zoom, Loom, or a service of your choice.
    - You can record specific fragments and then join them into one video.
3. Double-check that your video takes ~30min (and not longer than 35 min).
4. Make sure that your video is accessible online.
