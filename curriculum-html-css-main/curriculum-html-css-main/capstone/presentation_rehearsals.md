This exercise will guide you through the preparation process.

    1. Explain the project requirements to contextualize your project: say what was required. Show how your app looks and works in order to meet the requirements.
    2. Show how your app is implementing the provided design.
    3. Present how your app can adapt to different screen sizes. Explain how it works.
3. Technical questions: *Show pieces of code that prove your technical skills (Note: you need to present code written by you).* (10 min):
    1. You will need to answer 5 randomly selected questions.
4. Coding challenge: *Show how you solve a trivial coding challenge step-by-step.* (5 min):
    1. Solve the [Sum of odd Fibonacci numbers](https://classroom.github.com/a/w2k-xuwh) challenge

## Prepare your presentation

❗️ It is important that you prepare your presentation **before** recording it. You need to make sure that you comply with all requirements listed above.


Follow these steps to ensure your video complies with all requirements listed above:

1. Read the presentation outline that you have received via email today carefully and identify the 16 tasks you have to cover in your video.
2. Check the [assessment score description](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/capstone/articles/assessment_score.md) again and the expected performance for the tasks that you were assigned in the rubric.
3. Create the outline of your presentation.
4. For each of the tasks or questions, list the ideas you will cover in your answer and think about what are you going to show on your screen: specific lines of code, pull requests, features in the app, etc. (If applicable.) 
5. Add as many details as you wish but be conscious about the time. The outline should help you to record the video and to remember everything. Remember that the point is that you can show off your knowledge according to the rubric.
6. Practice your presentation. You might need a few attempts before you record a final video.
7. In the next exercise you will be asked to record the final version of your presentation.

## Check your video recording tools

We recommend to use Zoom for recording your presentation and later uploading the video to Google drive or youtube.
Here is a list of things that you should check:
- If you are able to record yourself and your screen with Zoom.
- If screensharing works as it should. Make sure that view that you are describing is visible in the video.
- If you are able to upload your video and how much time you need for that opeartion.
- If you are able to share your video with anybody who has a link.
