# Test your knowledge: Microverse program requirements

## Learning objectives

- Identify your mastery of the knowledge and skills required to participate successfully in the Microverse Full-stack program. 

### Estimated time: 0.75h


## Description

In this activity, you will test your mastery of basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub & Git, and pair programming. 


### Why is this important?

The Full-stack curriculum of Microverse is based on the assumption that students master basic knowledge and skills related to web technologies, **upon their enrollment**. Thus, the learning activities and resources included in the program will not cover these topics in depth. Since the program is very intensive, we recommend that you identify now any knowledge gaps that you might have and review the necessary content as soon as possible.
