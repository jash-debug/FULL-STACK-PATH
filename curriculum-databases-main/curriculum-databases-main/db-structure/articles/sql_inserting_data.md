# SQL: inserting data

## Requirements

- `PostgreSQL` server installed and running.
- `psql` installed
- A database to use
- A table named `students`

## Description

Now that you have a table you can start inserting data into it. For this we use SQL's `INSERT` statement, which can be used in two ways:

- Explicitly telling the columns for which you are providing values, not necessarily all of the existing columns.
```sql
INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, last_name) VALUES (33, 'Rory', 'Williams');
-- INSERT 0 1

INSERT INTO students (student_id, age, first_name, last_name) VALUES (42, 25, 'Amy', 'Pond');
-- INSERT 0 1
```

No need to define a value for `id`, it will be autogenerated and set when inserting due to it been defined as `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`.

- If adding values to all columns you don't need to specify them, you can just send the values, but they must have the same ordering of the columns in the table schema.
```sql
INSERT INTO students VALUES (4, 42, 25, 'Matt', 'Smith');
```

This won't work with our table because `id` is defined as `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`. This means that the value for `id` is always generated and never inserted unless a special override is used
