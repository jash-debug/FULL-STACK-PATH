# Sneak peek: Vet clinic database

## Learning objectives
- Build a relational database based on a real-life example.

### Estimated time: 0.25h

## Description

In the upcoming projects, you will use a relational database to create the data structure for a vet clinic. You will start with one table, and step by step, you will create a complete database with data about:
- animals
- animals' owners
- clinic employees
- visits

Apart from building data structure, you will be challenged with tasks that require SQL queries to answer specific questions.

### How to build your database

You will build your database in your local environment, and Microverse will not require you to share it. Therefore only you will have access to its data (which is a good thing from the security point of view). However, you will need to share all SQL queries you use to build and query your database to get feedback about them. 

### How to share your projects with a code reviewer

You will share your SQL queries as text files hosted in a GitHub repository. It is mandatory to use the [curriculum-databases-projects-template](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-databases-projects-template) to initialize the repository. You should keep the structure of files from the template. You will use the regular code review process for your projects.

### Projects list

You will be building your "Vet clinic" database for the whole week. Here is the list of projects that will guide you through the steps described above. You will find details about each of the project requirements in the upcoming program activities.
