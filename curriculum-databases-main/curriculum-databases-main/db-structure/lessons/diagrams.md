# Database schema diagram and entity relationship diagram

## Learning objectives
- Diagram a data model clearly and explain what it's doing.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description
Diagrams are a visual representation of your database. In general there are two types, database schema and entity relationship, both of which we will explore here.

### Why are diagrams important?
They provide a visual representation of the database and how data should move across it. Having this representation serves as part of the documentation and helps during discussions because people don't have to mentally keep it in their head, they just have to look at it.

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions as you learn about diagrams.*

- How would you explain your database design to a non-technical person?
- How can you document your database?

### Database schema diagram
A database schema shows each table, its columns (which is the primary key), and the links between them (foreign keys).

- Check examples of complex database schemas in [this article](https://database.guide/what-is-a-database-schema/).

### Entity relationship diagram
The entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows the actual relationships and their meaning. It's a bit more high level than your average diagram but gives a more precise picture of what each relationship is.
