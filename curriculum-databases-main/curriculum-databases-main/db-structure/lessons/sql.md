# SQL

## Learning objectives
- Explain what SQL is.
- Create tables in SQL.
- Insert and query data in SQL.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to interact with relational databases.

## Why is SQL important?

SQL is important because it is how you interact directly with databases. Yes, you might be able to work with databases through libraries and not use or write any SQL, but knowing what is happening underneath will prove to be an invaluable asset.

### Creating structures

- Read this documentation first: [PostgreSQL: Create table](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_create_table.htm).
- Make sure  that you understand [what a primary key is](https://learnsql.com/blog/primary-key-sql/).
- Read this article about [how to create SQL structures](../articles/sql_creating_structures.md) and try out SQL on your machine!
- Read more about [PostgreSQL Identity Column](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-identity-column/).
- Read more about [SQL data types](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-data-types.htm).


### Inserting data

- Read this documentation first: [SQL INSERT](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-insert-query.htm).
- Read this article explaining [how to insert data in SQL](../articles/sql_inserting_data.md).

### Querying data

- Read documentation on how to select your data: [SQL SELECT](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-select-query.htm).
- Read documentation on how to filter the data from your queries: [SQL WHERE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-where-clause.htm).
- Read how to query your data in [SQL: querying data](../articles/sql_querying_data.md).
