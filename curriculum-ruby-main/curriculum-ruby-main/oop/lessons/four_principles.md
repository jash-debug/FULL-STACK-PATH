# OOP: Four principles and their implementation in Ruby

## Learning objectives
- Understand the four main principles of OOP.
- Implement encapsulation and inheritance with Ruby.
- Run a program using the command line.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description
This lesson will introduce the four principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). These principles are the guiding ideas you should keep in mind when writing your code.

### Why are the four principles important?
Because they are the foundation upon which OOP is built. Having a good understanding of them will allow you to create solutions that are simpler to implement, understand, and maintain.

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions as you learn about the four principles.*

- How does encapsulation prevent bugs regarding invalid state/data in your objects?
- How does inheritance help reduce code duplication?

### Four principles
The four principles of OOP are:
- Encapsulation: An object's attributes can only be accessed/modified by one of its methods.
- Abstraction: Show only the things needed.
- Inheritance: The ability for one object to acquire properties from another object.
- Polymorphism: The ability to have many implementations of a single interface.
