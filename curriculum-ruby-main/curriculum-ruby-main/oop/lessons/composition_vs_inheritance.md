# Composition vs Inheritance

## Learning objectives
- Implement composition (as an example of a design pattern).

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description
In this lesson, you will learn about composition and how it compares with inheritance.

### Why is composition important?
Because composition can have most of the benefits of inheritance and provide other ones. It also saves you from a complicated problem called "multiple inheritances".

### Composition vs inheritance
Instead of having an object that inherits attributes and methods you can compose an object that has other *smaller* objects inside it and uses their attributes and methods. This is called composition.
