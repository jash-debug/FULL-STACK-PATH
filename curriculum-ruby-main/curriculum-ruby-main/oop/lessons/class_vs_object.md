# OOP: class vs object

## Learning objectives
- Explain the difference between classes and objects.
- Implement classes and objects in Ruby.
- Run a program using the command line.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description
In this lesson, you will learn about the subtle difference between a class and an object in object-oriented programming (OOP).

### Why are class and object important?
The foundation of OOP are objects so understanding what an object is and how you create and use them is a requirement in your learning journey.

### Class vs object
In short, a class is the definition of an object (attributes, methods, etc) and an object is an instance of a class (a variable of the type of that class).
