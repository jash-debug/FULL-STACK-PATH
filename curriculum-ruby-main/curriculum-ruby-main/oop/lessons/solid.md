# Best practices and SOLID

## Learning objectives
- Describe the SOLID principles of OOP.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description
In this lesson, you will learn about SOLID and how it helps you to have better practices when writing code.

### Why is SOLID important?
Because these principles establish ways to make your codebase more maintainable and prepare it for future growth. In general, they will help you write code that doesn't look bad months after the last time you saw it.

### SOLID
SOLID is an acronym for five object-oriented programming principles:

- **S** - Single-responsiblity Principle
- **O** - Open-closed Principle
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle
