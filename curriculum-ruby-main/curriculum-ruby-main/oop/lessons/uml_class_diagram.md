# UML class diagram

## Learning objectives
- Create a UML class diagram.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description
In this lesson, you will learn what a "UML class diagram" is and you will learn about a tool you can use to create your own.

### Why are UML class diagrams important?
Because they provide a blueprint for your solution. In turn, you can use this blueprint to discuss solutions with other developers more easily, and it is way easier to understand high-level software from a visual representation than from code.

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about this question as you learn about UML diagrams:*

- How could you give a high-level overview of your code?

### UML class diagrams
UML class diagrams are the main way of designing and talking about OOP solutions. They show the classes of the system, their interrelationships (including inheritance, aggregation, and association), and the operations and attributes of the classes.

You have already been exposed to this type of diagram: in the sneak peek for OOP, you were shown the [UML class diagram for school library](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-ruby/blob/main/oop/images/uml_class_diagram.png). In the next project, you will build all classes from that diagram.
