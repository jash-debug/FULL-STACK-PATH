# Unit tests with Rspec

## Learning objectives
- Write unit tests using Rspec.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description
In this lesson you will learn about Rspec and writing unit tests with it. Unit tests are the basis of testing; they verify that core functionality is working as expected or determine if a regression (a previously fixed bug) is introduced. Rspec is a framework for testing in Ruby.

### Why is unit testing important?
Because it is the foundation on which your entire application can rely. Due to the limited scope of unit testing, it can give you the certainty that a specific section of your code works as intended.

This in turn can give you a more maintainable code base and an easier time when working on it because when making changes you have a safety net that will tell you if something goes wrong.

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions as you learn about unit testing.*

- How would you verify that your code behaves as expected?
- How would you automate this verification?

### Unit testing
You already know what unit testing is from the previous modules, so let's just refresh our knowledge about them by reading the following article:

- [Unit testing best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices)

### Rspec
Rspec is a framework composed of multiple libraries designed to work together to make for the best possible experience when making tests.
