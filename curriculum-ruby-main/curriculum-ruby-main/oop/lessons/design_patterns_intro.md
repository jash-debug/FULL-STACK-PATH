# Design patterns intro

## Learning objectives
- Describe the advantages of using design patterns when writing software applications.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description
In this lesson, you will learn what design patterns are and how you might already have been using one without knowing.

### Why are design patterns important?
Because they give a common vocabulary and framework when talking about solutions. If the "X" pattern is proposed you (and others involved) can immediately know what it means and have a general idea about implementation details and trade-offs.

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about this question as you learn about design patterns:*

- How much effort would you have to make to explain Composition (or any pattern) every time you want to use it?

### Design patterns
Design patterns are a general solution to commonly occurring problems in software development. Think of them as recipes you can follow and alter to meet your needs.
