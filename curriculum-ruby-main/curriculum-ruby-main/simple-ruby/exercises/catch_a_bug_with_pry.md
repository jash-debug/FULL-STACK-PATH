# Catch a bug with pry!

## Learning objectives
- Find and fix a bug in code while in a synchronous call with an observer.
- Demonstrate an ability to use common debugging tools and techniques in Ruby.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

In this exercise you will practice your debugging skills in Ruby. You will learn about the [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) gem and use it for debugging.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise.*

### Instructions

- Introduce a bug in your existing Ruby repo. Do this in a new branch and describe what doesn't work. This should take no more than 20 minutes.
- [Install `pry` gem](https://github.com/pry/pry#manual).
- Read `pry`'s documentation and play with it for 10 minutes.
- Clone a repo from another student in your group - divide so no 2 students clone the same repo.
- When everybody is ready start recording the Zoom video.
- One by one share your screen and work through solving the bug in the repo you cloned (other team members can help).
  - Explain your thinking process.
  - Show how you look for the root cause of the bug.
  - Explain and implement the solution.
- Submit a link to the recorded video - this should be hosted in Google Drive.

### Submit your exercise
[Read this FAQ for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234)
Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your exercise. Paste a link to your video recording.
