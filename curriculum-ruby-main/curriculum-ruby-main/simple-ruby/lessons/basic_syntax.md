# Ruby - basic syntax

## Learning objectives
- Use Ruby syntax for basic programming operations.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson you will learn the syntax for doing things in Ruby. Since you already learned most (if not all) of the concepts in the JavaScript lesson here you will focus on syntax and Ruby specifics rather than re-learning about the same concepts.

### Why is syntax important?

Because even if it is the same concept underneath, two programming languages can have different syntax for it. In the following sections you will find articles explaining several different elements of syntax that are different in different programming languages.

### Data types
Ruby has a few more data types than JavaScript, but in general they are the same data types but with different names.

### Variables

- [Ruby variables](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_variables.htm)

### Conditionals

- [Ruby conditionals](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_if_else.htm)

### Loops
Instead of using the `for` keyword to make loops, you will find yourself using `each` and `times` methods in Ruby.

- [Ruby loops](https://www.rubyguides.com/ruby-tutorial/loops/)

### Methods
Methods in Ruby are just functions, the different name is just a naming convention for object-oriented programming when talking about functions in objects.
