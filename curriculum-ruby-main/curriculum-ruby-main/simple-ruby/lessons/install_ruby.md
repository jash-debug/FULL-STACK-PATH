# Ruby - installation party!

## Learning objectives
- Install Ruby in local environment.
- Run a program using command line.

### Estimated time: 1 hr

## Description
In this lesson, you will get familiar with Ruby as a programming language. You will also make sure that you can use Ruby on your machine.

### Why is it important?
In the upcoming weeks, you will build software with Ruby. In order to make that possible, you need to make sure that you can run Ruby on your computer.

###  What is Ruby?
Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. The creator of Ruby, Yukihiro Matsumoto, said that he designed Ruby to make programmers happy.

Compared to Python, whose syntax is similar to Ruby, Ruby is mainly used in the web development world. However, it can be used for any purpose.

### Let the party begin!

After this short introduction, let's make sure that you have access to Ruby on your machine.
- Follow the steps listed in the [Ruby - installation instructions](../articles/ruby_installation_instructions.md) article.

### Let's run Ruby code on your machine!
Now that you're happily done installing Ruby, it's time to start our adventure with this beautiful language.

- After successful installation, you should be able to use [IRB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell). IRB stands for "interactive Ruby shell," which is a tool to interactively execute Ruby expressions read from the standard input. With IRB we can start exploring Ruby without creating any files.
- Within your terminal run following command:
```bash
irb
```

Let's use the recognized example of Hello World.

```ruby
> print "Hello World"
Hello World => nil
```
Yeah! We have our first Ruby script running. More to come in the following activities!
