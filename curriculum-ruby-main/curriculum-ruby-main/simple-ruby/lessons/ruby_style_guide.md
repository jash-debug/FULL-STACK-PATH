# Ruby style guide

## Learning objectives
- Apply Ruby best practices and language style guides in code.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description
In this lesson you will learn some best practices and style guides for Ruby.

### Why is Ruby's style guide important?
Having a style guide makes your code more consistent. This means that it is easier to understand for everyone involved because it will look and feel the same no matter who worked on it. This helps a lot to reduce the mental overhead of learning a new codebase and prevents derailing code reviews by some person wanting code in some way and another in another way.

### Ruby style guide
