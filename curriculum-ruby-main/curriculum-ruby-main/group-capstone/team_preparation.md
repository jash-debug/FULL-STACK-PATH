# Ruby group capstone: preparation with your team

## Learning objectives
- Follow text written requirements (e.g., user stories).
- Use GitFlow to work with other developers in a team.
- Solve complex git conflicts.
- Write clear, professional, and respectful review comments for other team members.
- Explain "why" a change is requested when giving a code review.
- Perform a code review for a team member.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

This is the third time at Microverse that you will build a project in a group. 
Let's refresh on the processes and tools that you will be using with your team.
Besides - it's time to check what exactly you will build!

### Why is preparation as a team important?

Before you start splitting the work and coding, everyone must understand the task that is ahead of you.
If you make sure that you are on the same page, your work will be more effective.

#### Collaboration difficulties

 ‚ÄºÔ∏è üëâ Remember, in group projects, we will be looking for equal commits from each team member. **If you experience difficulties while collaborating with your group, please reach out to Student Success right away [by filling out this form.](https://airtable.com/shr8ApqXENQ0DSHto)** We are here to support you. Some difficulties might include a partner not showing up, a partner not doing their part of the work, a partner not holding up to their part of the agreement. We do not unpair students in group work, but we work with you to resolve the conflict. Reach out to Student Success earlier in the week as that gives us more time to resolve the issue. Students who do not do their part of the work and let their group do everything will repeat the week üëà ‚ÄºÔ∏è 

_Read and discuss all of the following points with your team during the Zoom call._

### Working with git

For all group projects, you will use Gitflow. Make sure that all of you:

- Understand how to use [Gitflow and how to open pull requests with the `dev` branch as a base branch](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Know how to solve [git conflicts](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/conflicts_git.md). It is very likely that your team will experience some merge conflicts.

_All links above are for lessons that you have already completed and practiced in group projects. Just make sure that every team member is familiar with this concept._

### Code reviews

For your group projects, you will be performing code reviews for your team members every day. Therefore, make sure that all of you:

- Know how to [perform a code review](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/give_code_review_basics.md).
- Remember how to [communicate well in code reviews](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/better_code_review.md).

_All links above are for lessons that you have already completed and practiced in group projects. Just make sure that every team member is familiar with this concept._

### Code review flow for Microverse group projects

For group projects, you will get code reviews from your teammates and external code reviewers; make sure that you understand the flow described in [this article](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/code_review_flow_group_projects.md).

_You have practiced it in group projects. Just make sure that every team member is familiar with this concept._

### Equal contribution from team members

Each member must contribute an equal amount of work to the group work. Not doing your part of the work can result in a repeat week. Team members are encouraged to notify Student Success as early as possible if someone is not participating with the group so Student Success can intervene and try to solve the situation before the end of the week. 

### Project requirements

- Now, it's time to read [the project requirements](./catalog_of_my_things.md). Treat it as a Sneak Peek and make sure that everybody on your team understands the challenge.
- For this group project, we **created an almost empty [Kanban board template](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-ruby/projects/1) - you can see only the task's placeholders**. However, we grouped the above requirements into [lists for each member of your team](catalog_of_my_things_divided.md).
- In the next activity, you will create a copy of that Kanban template and create tasks as a team!
