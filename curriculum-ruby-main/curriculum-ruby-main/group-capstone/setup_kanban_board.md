# Ruby group capstone: set up your Kanban board

## Learning objectives
- Use an empty Kanban board to manage tasks with the team and own time on the project.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this activity, your team will prepare a Kanban board with a GitHub project. We prepared an almost empty template that you need to copy.
All tasks in the template board are only placeholders. Your job will be to translate project requirements into separate tasks and to create a card for each task.
This is something you will do regularly when you're working as a developer.

Then, as always, you will need to split the tasks in a way that makes it so the estimated time is divided fairly between all members.
We prepared a list of requirements divided by team members in order to help you to tackle this challenge.
In order to copy the Kanban board quickly, you will use a special script prepared for you.

### Project requirements

- Join a Zoom call with your team. Only one person needs to copy the board on behalf of the entire team but everybody should help during the call.
- Create an empty repository for your group project.
- Follow the steps described in [curriculum-tools-copy-projects](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-tools-copy-projects) in order to copy the [[TEMPLATE] Ruby Group Capstone Project](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-ruby/projects/1) board.
- Open the GitHub project (Kanban board) in your team repo.
- Open [project requirements](./catalog_of_my_things.md) and read them carefully.
- Open [project requirements divided by team member](./catalog_of_my_things_divided.md) and compare it with the [project requirements](./catalog_of_my_things.md).
- Create tasks on your Kanban board based on the [project requirements divided by team member](./catalog_of_my_things_divided.md).
- Each task should be a separate card that:
    - Has a descriptive title.
    - Has the number of points in the `[Xpt]` prefix. That number should indicate the number of `points` that show how complex the task is. **1 point = 1 hour of estimated work**. You shouldn't change the points after dividing up cards, even if the actual work takes longer.
    - Has a description of the task.
- Each of the team members should assign themselves to the cards as divided in the [project requirements divided by team member](./catalog_of_my_things_divided.md) (and time estimate distributions should be fair - no single person should be doing all of the most time-consuming tasks). Decide who will be the assignee for the cards marked as group tasks. All cards on your Kanban board should have assignees.
- [Open a new issue in your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
    - In its description, paste a link to your GitHub project.
    - Add a note telling the reviewer how many people there are in your team.
    - Add a note telling the reviewer which team member was assigned to tasks listed for: `Team member #1`, `Team member #2`, `Team member #3`  `Team member #4` (if your team has 4 members). Use your GitHub usernames.
- Use the issue link to ask for a review. A code reviewer will leave you feedback in the issue's comment.
    - As it is your first time using a GitHub project and Kanban board, we need to double-check your setup to avoid problems while working on your project.

## Work and submission mode

- You should implement the above requirements only in **one repository** in your group.
- You should ask for a review and submit this activity **on behalf of your group.**

## Code review

Follow [these steps](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/how_to_ask_for_a_code_review.md) to request a code review of your project.
**Special case: instead of a pull request, you need to use an issue to communicate with your reviewer.**

## Submit your project

After the final approval from a code reviewer, you need to submit your project.
[Read this FAQ for a reminder on how to submit your project.](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234)
