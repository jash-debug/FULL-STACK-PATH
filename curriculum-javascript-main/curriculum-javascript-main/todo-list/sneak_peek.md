# Sneak peek: To-do list

## Learning objectives
- Build a website based on an existing website.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete.
You will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and you will do it using ES6 and Webpack!

### How to build the "To-do list" website?

You will build a very simple yet powerful to-do list. It will be inspired by the minimalist website. That website is already offline but you can still play with it thanks to [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180320194056/http://www.getminimalist.com:80/).

Your task is to build a website that displays a list that looks and behaves like the part of minimalist project capture in the video below.

[![Minimalist example](https://img.youtube.com/vi/AcUd-_Yjjqg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcUd-_Yjjqg)

You will need to implement the following functionalities (presented in the video above):
- Adding a new item.
- Removing a selected item.
- Marking a selected item as complete.
- Removing all items marked as complete at once.
- Reordering a selected item (as drag-and-drop) _[as an additional feature]_.

### Projects list

You will be building a "To-do list" website during the whole week. Here is the list of projects that will guide you through the functionalities described above. You will find details about each of the project requirements in the upcoming program activities.
