## Learning objectives

- Understand the pros and cons of different approaches of connecting Ruby on Rails back-end with React front-end.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Why is the react-rails gem important?

Rails is still a very widely used framework but many people still prefer to use JavaScript frameworks for front-end features. As such, integrating React into your Rails project can have several benefits, some less obvious than others. 

The most obvious reason is ease. As Microverse students, you're already familiar with React so creating a front-end with familiar technology is always more comfortable. However, as you get more experienced with Rails you will find there's really very little it can't do.

Another reason you might want a React front-end could be for compatibility. There are lots of prebuilt features ready and waiting to be used in a new app and several of them are written in React. Additionally, converting a web app into a mobile or desktop app becomes very easy as things like Ionic and Electron are able to compile your React code, while it is unable to do so with Ruby.

Whatever the reason, the react-rails gem helps you seamlessly integrate your React front-end with your Rails back-end for one versatile monolithic app that can be hosted from a single source.  

At the end of the day, some people like their sandwich cut into rectangles while others like it in triangles, some like the crust on their toast and others don't. Ultimately there's no wrong choice and the best choice may differ from project to project!

#### How to use react-rails gem

 - Visit the [react-rails gem repo](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) for their step-by-step guide to adding this gem to your project. The documentation is very comprehensive and a bit overwhelming. However, in the next step you will follow a very straigh-forward tutorial.
