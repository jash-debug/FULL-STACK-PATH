# Package management system for Ruby

## Learning objectives

- Use RubyGems as a software package system.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## 'Gems' is just a cute name

The term 'gems' is a fancy way of referring to libraries in Ruby. A ruby is a gemstone, after all! You may have heard of plugins or extensions. It's all the same thing. In fact, even Rails itself is technically a gem!

### Why is RubyGems important?

RubyGems is the package manager that handles all the gems on your machine. From the command line you can search for gems, install and uninstall gems, list current gems, and perform other such commands. As a repository of gems, it's not only a great resource for finding gems to work with, you can also publish your own gems there!

#### What are Ruby Gems?

There's nothing in a gem that is impossible to build yourself!  In fact, many gems are open source and if you find a bug in one, you are encouraged to contribute. It is also often encouraged to use gems in web development, as it means using a library that was created to do a job and is maintained by experienced developers towards that end, saving you valuable time. So just like you've used the libraries in JavaScript, such as Luxon, there are lots of gems out there that, when combined, can help you build a fully functioning web app at lightning speed! 
 
  - Explore [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) for yourself to make sure you have it set up locally and to see some of the gems available to you!

A word of caution though. In Rails anyone can make a gem, so be careful to only use well-established ones. This does not mean you should jump straight into using the trusted ones either! You should work to understand the basics of how many of these libraries function and interact with the Rails infrastructure before getting a gem to do the job for you, or you'll end up not understanding your own project.
