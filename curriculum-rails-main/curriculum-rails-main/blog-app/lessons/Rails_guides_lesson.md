# Rails guides as a knowledge base

## Learning objectives

- Use Rails documentation.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

The Rails guides are a wonderfully comprehensive, but frustratingly enormous, resource that you will come to rely on time and time again. These guides have been maintained for previous versions, the current stable version, and the most recent version of Rails. As such, it can all be quite confusing. You will often find the documentation to be frustrating, sometimes because it's so expansive and other times because it's so bad. Luckily for us, we don't have to read all of the guides!

### Why is understanding how to use the Rails guide important?

Throughout your entire career as a developer you will rely on documentation to help yourself navigate frameworks, APIs, and packages. Being comfortable with how to use these guides, not just the content in them, is a vital skill for all developers. Einstein was known not to memorize something if he knew where to find it, so let's take a page from his book and learn HOW to find information!

### Guides Homepage
 - Start at [the Ruby on Rails Homepage](https://rubyonrails.org/) and click 'Guides' or skip straight to [the Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) homepage.
 
     - The first thing we always need to make sure of is that we are looking at the right version. While a lot of the information contained in the guides is going to be very similar from version to version, some of it is going to change. That's the whole point of different versions. We can check the URL to make sure we're in the right place. If your URL path starts with `/v5.2/`, or any other numbers, you're in a previous version of Rails. Additionally, if your URL starts with `edgeguides.rubyonrails` instead of `guides.rubyonrails` then you're in the most recently released version of Rails, not the most stable version.

- Skim through the first section: ['Getting Started with Rails'](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#what-is-rails-questionmark). You don't need to follow along with the app they set up as you will be doing a similar one in the upcoming activities, but you will find some good information to reiterate what you are learning here.

### How to use the guides
The Rails guides are very well divided into sections with every heading anchored. So, if you need to learn about a specific thing you can find a corresponding section and read only the relevant section. For example, if you need to know how to create a new Rails app, you need [this section](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project).

As you're still learning, it's of course suggested that you read a little extra now and then but anything you could need to know about Rails is somewhere in the guides and a little searching will bring you to the section you need. Don't try to learn everything in the guides at once, just find the sections you need and try to put what you read into action. Remember that even senior developers have never even sat through and read these guides from front to back. Instead, they refer to them so often that they've eventually read all of it over the course of their career.

### Where to go next?

Wherever you want! Feel free to explore the guides, look into some topics you are already unsure of or just curious about. Get comfortable with this resource. Get comfortable finding the information you need but also learning to skip over the information that you don't need yet. There may seem to be a lot here but that's exactly what's so great about the Rails guides! 

## Additional materials 

*These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.*

- [GoRails](https://gorails.com/guides) is full of great lessons and tutorials built for handling specific needs, like how to [Install Ruby on Rails](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/21.04) on Ubuntu or how to [debug performance problems in your views](https://gorails.com/episodes/debugging-rails-performance-problems-in-views?autoplay=1).

- [RailsGirls](http://guides.railsgirls.com/) is a great resource originally created for women in tech but definitely useful for everyone. They've also translated the guides into 10 languages on their page and are open to contributions!
