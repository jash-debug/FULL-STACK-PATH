## Model View Controller Architecture

The <b>M</b>odel <b>V</b>iew <b>C</b>ontroller architecture is like a recipe you can use to build your web application. It exists as a way to structure the pathways we use when routing data through a project. Essentially what our MVC acronym refers to is the way we direct traffic (with a controller) as it comes in from an external source, looks for data (monitored by the model), and is displayed for the user (through the view).

### Why is MVC architecture important?

MVC architecture allows us to have a structured way of understanding our data flow. Even though many different technology stacks have many different exact definitions for what the model, view, and controller should handle, it can be said that they are all similar enough that we've been able to establish a common pattern. That pattern is collectively referred to as the MVC. This means that no matter what direction your technology journey may take you, having a solid understanding of this concept now will always put you on solid ground in the future.
