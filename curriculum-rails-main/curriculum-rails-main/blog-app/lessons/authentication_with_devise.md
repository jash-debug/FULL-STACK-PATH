# Authentication with devise gem

## Learning objectives
- Build a web app that requires the user to log in.
- Use devise gem for authentication.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description

Devise is a gem built to handle everything related to authentication for Rails. You install the gem, run an installer, and you will have a working authentication flow. It is composed of 10 modules that you can mix and match as needed and a rich extensions community to expand beyond what is offered.

### Why is devise important?

Knowing Devise is important because it has become the de-facto authentication library used in most Rails projects. So understanding how to integrate it with your system will be crucial. Also, having an understanding of it will simplify the process of getting to know a new system, one less thing to know.

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions as you learn about devise.*

- How would you implement authentication without devise?
- How does it fit in an application?

### Devise

As mentioned above, Devise is an authentication solution for Rails. In general, it will have the same or a pretty similar, configuration on every app.
