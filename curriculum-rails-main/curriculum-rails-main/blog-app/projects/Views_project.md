# Blog app - Views

## Learning objectives
- Use preprocessed HTML file with embedded Ruby code.
- Use layouts and templates for shared content.

### Estimated time: 3.5h

## Description
In this project you will be adding the Views associated with the Models and Controllers you've already created for your Blog App.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you have used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### Ruby requirements
- Follow our list of [best practices for Ruby](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-ruby/blob/main/articles/ruby_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements
- Implement the design from the sneak peek wireframes.
    - Styling is nice to have but focus on making sure everything functions first. (Note: Ignore login logic, you would be using Devise in coming milestone)

**Note: Analyze the wireframes deeply and try to identify all the necessary elements and how a user would navigate from one page to another**

- Use methods that you have created in the [Blog App - processing data in models](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-rails/blob/main/blog-app/projects/Processing_data_model_project.md).
- **Hint:** In order to see some posts or comments, you might need to add some data to your database as described [here](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-rails/blob/main/blog-app/projects/Processing_data_model_project.md#use-models-to-insert-data).
