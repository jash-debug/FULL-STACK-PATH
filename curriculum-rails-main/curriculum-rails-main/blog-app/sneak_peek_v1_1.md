# Sneak peek: Blog app

## Learning objectives

- Diagram a data model clearly and explain what it's doing.
- Understand how to use medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

The Blog app will be a classic example of a blog website. You will create a fully functional website that will show the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts.

### How to build the Blog app

The end result should follow the following data model (this is an Entity Relationship Diagram that you are already familiar with):

</p>

For this project you will have full freedom in terms of visual design but you will need to keep the following wireframes:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/blog_login.png" alt="Login page wireframe" width="250px" />
  <img src="./images/blog_root_users.png" alt="All users page wireframe"  width="250px"  />
  <img src="./images/blog_user_page.png" alt="Single user page wireframe"  width="250px"  />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/blog_user_all_posts.png" alt="All posts by a given user page wireframe"  width="250px"  />
  <img src="./images/blog_single_post.png" alt="Single post page wireframe"  width="250px"  />
</p>

You will be guided step by step, and because of that you will have a chance to practice your knowledge about basic Ruby on Rails concepts - starting from the Views and finishing the database connection. You will also implement ideas like authentication, authorization, and all kinds of tests. In the last step, you will have a chance to create an API instead of API consumption.
