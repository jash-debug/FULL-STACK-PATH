# Blog app - API documentation

## Learning objectives
- Generate documentation for an API.
- Understand importance of APIs and docs following standards.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise
In this exercise, you will add documentation for your API endpoints using [rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag). Remember that this involves writing the specs that will then be turned into actual documentation and accessible in [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) at `/api-docs`

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise.*

### Instructions

1. Write the API integration specs using [rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag#getting-started) for your existing endpoints.
2. Generate the documentation.

**You need to use pair-programming for this exercise. Therefore you need to select one of the repos in your pair-programming group in which you will implement the above features (select the one that have API endpoints created).**
