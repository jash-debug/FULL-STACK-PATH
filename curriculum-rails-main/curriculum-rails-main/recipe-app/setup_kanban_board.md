# RoR group project: set up your Kanban board

## Learning objectives
- Use an empty Kanban board to manage tasks with the team and own time on the project.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this activity, your team will prepare a Kanban board with a GitHub project. This time there is not template to copy. You should create a Kanban board from scratch.
Then your job will be to translate project requirements into separate tasks and to create a card for each task.
This is something you will do regularly when you're working as a developer.

Then, as always, you will need to split the tasks in a way that makes it so the estimated time is divided fairly between all members.
We prepared a list of requirements divided by team members in order to help you to tackle this challenge.

### Project requirements

- Join a Zoom call with your team. Only one person needs to create the board on behalf of the entire team but everybody should help during the call.
- Create an empty repository for your group project.
- Open the GitHub project (Kanban board) in your team repo (set up the same columns as in previous group projects).
- Open [project requirements](./buisness_requirements.md) and read them carefully.
- Create tasks on your Kanban board based on the [project requirements](./buisness_requirements.md).
- Each task should be a separate card that:
    - Has a descriptive title.
    - Has the number of points in the `[Xpt]` prefix. That number should indicate the number of `points` that show how complex the task is. **1 point = 1 hour of estimated work**. You shouldn't change the points after dividing up cards, even if the actual work takes longer.
    - Has a description of the task.
- Each of the team members should assign themselves to the cards (and time estimate distributions should be fair - no single person should be doing all of the most time-consuming tasks). Decide who will be the assignee for the cards marked as group tasks. All cards on your Kanban board should have assignees. 
**NOTE you should distribite tasks in a way that gives each team member a chance to work with different parts of RoR. The number of assigned points should be equal (+/- 5 points) for each member.**
- [Open a new issue in your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
    - In its description, paste a link to your GitHub project.
    - Add a note telling the reviewer how many people there are in your team.
- Use the issue link to ask for a review. A code reviewer will leave you feedback in the issue's comment.
    - As it is your first time using a GitHub project and Kanban board, we need to double-check your setup to avoid problems while working on your project.

## Work and submission mode

- You should implement the above requirements only in **one repository** in your group.
- You should ask for a review and submit this activity **on behalf of your group.**

## Code review

Follow [these steps](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/how_to_ask_for_a_code_review.md) to request a code review of your project.
**Special case: instead of a pull request, you need to use an issue to communicate with your reviewer.**

## Submit your project

After the final approval from a code reviewer, you need to submit your project.
